    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                <div id="assignment" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Assignment</h2>
                    <p>This week is all about - that's right - functionality. You should be spending your time fleshing out your interactive prototype. Focus on getting the flow of your interaction working. Don't worry about making it look pretty yet. Don't stall or get too caught up in the look and feel of things. Fonts, colors, and pixel-perfect layout can come later. This week, you'll need to make good progress on the interaction design. Using <a href=http://d.ucsd.edu/class/intro-hci/2015/lab/lab4>the handlebars techniques you learned in lab</a>, read data from JSON to customize the presentation of pages and deliver rich interactivity. By now you should have a good idea the kinds of data your app will utilize. Eventually, you will be required to send and retrieve data from your database as part of the final project requirements. But for now, you are only focusing on retrieving and manipulating fixed data that need not be updated on the back end. In terms of Lab 5, this means you will have a file like data.json that has data pre-stored, and your job is to retrieve that data and populate your app with it and add new objects to the data variable. You do not need to dynamically update the data.json file with new data. </p>
                    <p>Follow the development plan you created last week, and update it as you go. Mark tasks that have been completed and add new ones if you need to. Make sure that your next week is planned out with goals and who is responsible for each task. (If you'd like to give yourself the option of "late days", set an early deadline so your schedule has some flexibility.) Re-evaluate your stretch goals and what's feasible and what isn't. You may decide that your plan is too ambitious, or you may decide that your plan is too conservative; maneuver accordingly.</p>

				<div id="instudio" class="sidenav-anchor">
					<h2>In Studio</h2>
                    <p>When you arrive to studio this week, your studio leader will have your design loaded on a mobile device, plugged into the shared display. A member of your studio who is not on your team will walk through your prototype and think out loud as they do so. You will receive feedback, and then discuss your development plan with your studio.</p>
				</div>

                <div id="examples" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Student Examples</h2>
                    <p>Here are some examples of development plans:<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ame-4omKIpLddDlvTGFqN0JqNEVXbGRGSndLc2NuTUE&usp=sharing" target="_blank"> (1) is very stylized</a>, dynamic, and mostly thorough,<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlCum_THvFsddGJlR1FrZ2xiSzlRdFZfUHBKcm9HUVE#gid=0" target="_blank"> (2) is fairly thorough</a>, colorful, but is missing time estimates and has only one stretch goal listed,
					<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkDAkl06cS84dDdoWnJKNmFPLVhNTUx4Ry1mYWZob2c&hl=en_US#gid=0" target="_blank"> (3) is a mediocre plan</a> that's mostly thorough, where most tasks are broken down into less than 1 hour chunks,
					<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnCm_JDaoi7ndG5fNl92YUFrWDgwdUxyVVB2azg5SVE#gid=2" target="_blank"> (4) is very thorough</a>, with time estimates and time costs, but some tasks could be more actionable,
					<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fspark-public.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fhci%2Fsource_videos%2FEvolutionOfAProjectPlan.mp4&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNECkSqe0VFyN4wOICycQIFhJoAslg" target="_blank"> (5) is a great video</a> of the dynamic nature of implementation plans throughout the project.</p>
					
					<p>In this assignment, we want to emphasize the user task at this stage of development. The interface should be fluid with respect to a particular task made intuitively easy to step through as a user. <a href="http://iamherefor.com/index.html" target="_blank"> Here we see a good example of an app that is fully centered on the user's task. </a> For this assignment, this team would complete functionality by capturing all of the relevant information entered into the text boxes, and updating the content of each page with that new information.</p>
					
					<p><a href="../examples/images/a07e1p1.mp4">GradeSource++</a>: This example project from last year abstracts GradeSource for you and works with the data to show you where you are in a class. </p>
                    <p><a href="../examples/images/a07e2p1.mp4">Balancr</a>: This app helps people balance their time between work and play. They have done a wonderful job making the app functional-- you can create a sign-up, add activities, and see it reflected on the pie chart.</p>
					<p>For both examples above, simply imagine that the data that undergirds the functionality of the apps are only temporarily stored in a data variable that is pre-populated with data from a .json file. Next week, the focus will be on creating a more persistent database for your app.</p>
